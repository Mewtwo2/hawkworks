<blockquote><p>HawkWorks is a multi-disciplinary group that focuses on project-based science and engineering. Our membership includes undergraduate and graduate students in the physical sciences and engineering departments, with a core of experienced officers. New member experience is not an issue, members are taught by the entire group skills like CAD modeling, metalworking using mills and lathes, and the handling of 3D printers.

We are taking on a number of projects including a Turbo-shaft vehicle and a low-temperature differential sterling engine. We also operate our completed Large Singing Tesla Coil at events around the state.</p></blockquote>
